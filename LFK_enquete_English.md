<In the last 1 year I haved learned ->

### Among the technologies you are recently interersted in, give us the name of one and the reason it draws your attention (list upto three points).

Typescript 

It try to implement the OOP to make javascript more maintainable

### Among the projects you have worked on, which one are you  most proud of? What were your tasks in the project, and how did you use your knowledge/skills to come up with the solution?

SBLCENTER 

Which is project about Stock broker securities lending , 
It' brand new project in the meantime depend on government's requirement , 
So there are some problems i need to face :

1.Tough deadline
2.Need to integrate old version application
3.Go to the next generation tech for maintainable purpose
4.Large scope reports and functionalities requirement
5.Our developers is not good both font-end and backend

Old version application still build in Server-side style programing which may  mix business logic with UI , 
We try to use MVC style for maintainalbe and resource reuse purpose , so we extract some business logic into REST API style so that make old application can alive with new application

Due to the point 5 , we can not just allow one person do the full-stack work which make work slow , under MVC style programing , we can easily split into font-end and back-end works 

We have a lots of reports need to build
1.We try to splite works into database work and backend work due to some people is good in database
2.Use third-party reporint service to easily to buld the UI of report and scall possibility

Some UI is complex
Becuase the industry character , some ui is complex make hard maintainable , so we induct Angular to resolve this , 
make UI more OOP
