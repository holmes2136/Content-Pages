### Among the projects you have worked on, which one are you  most proud of? What were your tasks in the project, and how did you use your knowledge/skills to come up with the solution?
```
SBLCENTER project
I as a full-stack developer , introduce MVC and RESTful coding into project , 
also componment the UI to let evey developer following the standard so that  easily process their work.

Which is a project about stock broker securities lending , 
It's brand new project in the meantime depend on government's requirement , 
So there are some problems i need to face :

1. Tough deadline
2. Need to integrate with old version application
3. Introduce MVC style and RESTful coding for maintainable purpose
4. Large scope reports and functionalities requirements
5. Too much ui requirement and we use Angular to resolve complicate UI
6. Our developers most only good at font-end or backend

Old version application builded by Server-side style programing which mix business logic with UI , 
We try to use MVC framework for maintainalbe purpose , and we also extract business logic into REST API  so that make resource can be used by old application and new application , and in the future we even can implement unit-test more easily

According  point 5 , some problems as following :
1.We need to consistent all the ui make sure they have same style , same action
We compoment all the UI and injecct bootstrap so that we can make sure resolve above prolblem
2.Some UI is complex
Becuase the industry feature , some ui is complicate make it hard to maintain , so we introduce Angular to resolve this , 
make UI more OOP 

According to the point 6 , we can not just allow one person do the full-stack work which make progress slow , under MVC style programing , we can easily split into font-end and back-end works 

We have a lots of reports need to build
1.We try to splite works into database work and backend work due to some people is good in database
2.Use third-party reporting service to easily to buld the UI of report and scall possibility
